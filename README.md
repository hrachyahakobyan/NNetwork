# NNetwork
A C++ implementation of feed-forward multi-layer neural network.

# NNmatrix

A simple, datatype templated custom matrix class used for matrix arithmetics in the network.

# NNetwork

A feed-forward neural network class with adjustable user-defined number of layers and neurons.
Learning is based on the stochastic gradient method with adjustable batch size and learning rate.

The program is currently tuned to learn and verify hand written digits from MNIST database.
The program is created for the learning purposes only and is fat too slow for production.
