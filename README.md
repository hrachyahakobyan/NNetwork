# NNetwork
A C++ implementation of feed-forward multi-layer neural network. 

# NNetwork

A feed-forward neural network class with adjustable user-defined number of layers and neurons in each layer.
Currently supporting two types of activation functions 
* Sigmoid
* Softmax

The program supports 2 types of cost functions (yet)
* Quadratic cost
* Cross-entropy

Learning is based on the stochastic gradient method with adjustable batch size and learning rate.
